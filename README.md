# Battle Robot

This project features a formidable battle robot that is skillfully controlled by a Flysky controller. The repository contains the code to operate the robot, images showcasing its design, testing videos in action, the circuit diagram detailing its electrical components, and much more. With its differential drive system, powerful weapon blade, and precise maneuverability, this robot is ready to take on challenges in battles.

## Features

- Differential Drive Control: The robot is equipped with two motors for driving, controlled by an Arduino UNO with a Flysky receiver. This configuration allows for precise and responsive control.

- Weapon Blade: A motor-driven weapon blade adds an element of offense to the robot. The Arduino UNO controls this motor's ON/OFF state through a relay, enhancing the robot's combat capabilities.

- Arduino Uno: The Arduino Uno microcontroller board is the brain of the Robot, responsible for motor control, communication with the remote controller, coordination of the weapon blade, and processing commands received from the remote controller receiver.

- L298 Motor Driver: The L298 motor driver is used to interface the Arduino Uno with the two driving motors, providing the necessary power and control signals.

- Relay: A relay is incorporated into the system to control the weapon blade motor. It allows the Arduino Uno to switch the motor on or off, providing precise control during battles

- Power Source: The robot is powered by a Li-Po (Lithium Polymer) battery, providing the necessary energy for prolonged battles.


## Usage

Review the code in the `code/` directory to understand how the robot interprets Flysky controller signals, controls the motors, and manages the weapon blade.
